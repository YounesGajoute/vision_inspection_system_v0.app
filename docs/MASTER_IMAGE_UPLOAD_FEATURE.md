# Master Image Upload Feature

## Overview

The Master Image Registration step now supports loading images from your computer in addition to capturing from the camera.

---

## Features

### Two Options for Master Image Registration

#### Option 1: Capture from Camera
- Use the integrated camera to capture a live image
- Automatic quality assessment
- Real-time preview with camera settings applied
- Quality metrics displayed (brightness, sharpness, exposure)

#### Option 2: Load from Computer ✨ NEW
- Upload existing images from your laptop/computer
- Support for all common image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, etc.)
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Drag and drop or file browser selection

---

## How to Use

### Loading Image from Computer

1. Navigate to the "Master Image Registration" step (Step 2) in the configuration wizard
2. Click the "Load File" button
3. Select an image file from your computer
4. Preview the loaded image
5. Click "Register" to set it as the master image

### Supported Image Formats

- JPEG / JPG
- PNG
- BMP
- TIFF / TIF
- GIF
- WebP
- And any other format supported by the browser

### File Size Limit

- Maximum: 10MB per image
- Recommended: 1-5MB for optimal performance

---

## User Interface

### Button Layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Capture]  [Load File]  [Register]         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Capture** - Capture image from camera  
**Load File** - Load image from computer (NEW!)  
**Register** - Register the current image as master

### Image Source Indicator

After loading an image, you'll see an indicator showing the source:

📷 **Camera**: "Image captured from camera"  
📁 **Upload**: "Image loaded from: filename.jpg"

---

## Validation

### File Type Validation
- Only image files are accepted
- Error message shown for non-image files

### File Size Validation
- Files larger than 10MB are rejected
- Clear error message with size limit

### Image Preview
- Immediate preview after loading
- Same display as captured images

---

## Technical Details

### Implementation

**File:** `components/wizard/Step2MasterImage.tsx`

**Key Changes:**
- Added file input element (hidden)
- New `handleFileSelect()` and `handleFileChange()` functions
- File type and size validation
- Base64 conversion for consistency with captured images
- Image source tracking (camera vs upload)

### Data Flow

```
1. User clicks "Load File"
2. File browser opens
3. User selects image file
4. Validation checks:
   - Is it an image? (file.type.startsWith('image/'))
   - Is size < 10MB? (file.size < 10 * 1024 * 1024)
5. FileReader converts to base64
6. Image displayed in preview
7. User clicks "Register"
8. Image saved to program configuration
```

### State Management

New state variables:
```typescript
const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = useState(false);
const [imageSource, setImageSource] = useState<'camera' | 'upload' | null>(null);
const [uploadedFileName, setUploadedFileName] = useState<string | null>(null);
const fileInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
```

## Benefits

### 1. Flexibility
- Use existing high-quality reference images
- No need to physically have reference sample on-site
- Import images from different locations/times

### 2. Convenience
- Faster setup when reference images already exist
- Useful for remote configuration
- Easy to swap between different reference images

### 3. Quality Control
- Use professionally photographed reference images
- Consistent lighting and positioning
- Pre-validated image quality

---

## Use Cases

### 1. Remote Setup
Configure inspection programs without physical access to the inspection area.

### 2. Multiple Similar Products
Use the same reference image across multiple inspection stations.

### 3. Documentation
Keep reference images in a central repository for easy access and version control.

### 4. Quality Assurance
Use certified "golden samples" photographed under controlled conditions.

### 5. Offline Configuration
Prepare inspection programs offline and deploy when connected.

## Error Handling

### Invalid File Type
```
Title: "Invalid File"
Message: "Please select an image file (JPEG, PNG, etc.)"
```

### File Too Large
```
Title: "File Too Large"  
Message: "Please select an image smaller than 10MB"
```

### Load Failed
```
Title: "Load Failed"
Message: "Failed to read image file"
```

### No Image
```
Title: "No Image"
Message: "Please capture or load an image first"
```

---

## Best Practices

### Image Quality
- Use high-resolution images (at least 1280x720)
- Ensure good lighting and focus
- Avoid compression artifacts
- Use lossless formats (PNG, TIFF) when possible

### File Management
- Keep original reference images backed up
- Use descriptive filenames
- Maintain version control for reference images

### Consistency
- Use the same camera/lighting as production when possible
- Capture reference images at the same distance/angle
- Ensure similar background and environment

---

## Comparison: Camera vs Upload

| Feature | Camera Capture | File Upload |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Quality Metrics** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Real-time Preview** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Convenience** | Requires setup | Easy & quick |
| **Flexibility** | On-site only | Anywhere |
| **Quality Control** | Variable | Consistent |
| **File Size** | Controlled | Up to 10MB |

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Batch upload for multiple reference images
- Image editing tools (crop, rotate, adjust)
- Cloud storage integration
- Image quality assessment for uploaded images
- Reference image library management

---

## Troubleshooting

### Image Not Loading
1. Check file format is supported
2. Verify file size < 10MB
3. Try a different image file
4. Check browser console for errors

### Image Quality Issues
1. Use higher resolution images
2. Avoid heavily compressed JPEGs
3. Ensure proper lighting in original photo
4. Consider re-capturing with camera if quality is critical

### Registration Fails
1. Ensure image is loaded/captured
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Try capturing new image
4. Reload the page and try again

---

## API Integration

The uploaded image is handled the same way as captured images:

```typescript
// Both camera and upload result in base64 data
setMasterImageData(base64Data);

// Registration process is identical
const blob = new Blob([arrayBuffer], { type: 'image/jpeg' });
const file = new File([blob], 'master_image.jpg');
// Upload to backend...
```

---

## Security & Privacy

- Files are processed locally in the browser
- No automatic upload to external services
- Images stored securely in the backend
- File size limits prevent abuse
- Type validation prevents malicious files

---

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Chromium) 90+
- ✅ Firefox 88+
- ✅ Safari 14+
- ✅ Opera 76+

**Note:** Requires FileReader API support (available in all modern browsers)

---

## Summary

The Master Image Upload feature provides a flexible and convenient way to register reference images without requiring camera access. This enhancement improves workflow efficiency, especially for remote configuration scenarios and when high-quality reference images already exist.

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Two options: Camera capture or File upload
- ✅ Support for all image formats
- ✅ Easy to use interface
- ✅ Proper validation and error handling
- ✅ Consistent with existing workflow
