# 🚀 Quick Start: Testing New ROI Drawing

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

The correct ROI drawing process has been implemented with automatic edit mode, resize handles, and save/cancel functionality.

---

## 🎯 What Changed?

### New Feature: Automatic Edit Mode
When you draw an ROI and release the mouse, the system now:
1. **Automatically enters EDIT MODE** (no more instant save!)
2. Shows **8 resize handles** (corners + edges)
3. Displays **Save Tool** and **Cancel** buttons
4. Enables **threshold adjustment slider**
5. Lets you **resize, move, and adjust** before saving

---

## 🏃 Quick Test (3 Minutes)

### Step 1: Start Application
```bash
npm run dev:all
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Tool Configuration
1. Open browser: `http://localhost:3000/configure`
2. Complete Step 1 (Image Optimization) - click Next
3. Complete Step 2 (Master Image) - capture image, click Next
4. You're now at Step 3 (Tool Configuration)

### Step 3: Test New ROI Drawing
1. **Select Tool**: Click "Area Tool" button on the right
2. **Draw ROI**: Click and drag on canvas to draw rectangle
3. **Auto Edit Mode**: Release mouse → **Edit mode appears!** ✨
4. **Observe**: You should see:
   - ✅ 8 white square handles on ROI
   - ✅ "Save Tool" and "Cancel" buttons below canvas
   - ✅ Title changed to "Edit ROI - Drag handles..."
   - ✅ Threshold slider is now enabled

### Step 4: Test Editing
1. **Resize**: Drag corner handle → ROI resizes
2. **Move**: Drag inside ROI body → ROI moves
3. **Threshold**: Adjust slider → value updates

### Step 5: Save
1. Click **"Save Tool"** button
2. **Observe**: Tool appears in "Configured Tools" list
3. ✅ Success!

- Slider **enabled only in edit mode**
- Adjust from 0 to 100
- Value saves with tool

### 4. Save/Cancel
- **Save Tool** → Adds to configured list
- **Cancel** → Discards changes

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your test is successful if you can:

1. ✅ Select a tool type
2. ✅ Draw an ROI with dashed preview
3. ✅ See edit mode appear automatically
4. ✅ See and interact with 8 handles
5. ✅ Resize ROI using handles
6. ✅ Move ROI by dragging body
7. ✅ Adjust threshold slider
8. ✅ Save tool to configured list
9. ✅ Cancel works (discards ROI)
10. ✅ Add multiple different tools

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results
- Draw ROIs at least 50x50 pixels (easier to see handles)
- Try all 4 corner handles
- Try all 4 edge handles
- Try moving ROI around canvas
- Try adjusting threshold before saving
- Try canceling to see it discard

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Drawing too small (< 10x10) - ROI rejected
- ❌ Not selecting tool first - warning toast
- ❌ Clicking without dragging - ROI too small

**Issue**: Can't select tool during edit
**Solution**: This is intentional! Save or cancel first

**Issue**: Threshold slider disabled
**Solution**: Must be in edit mode (after drawing ROI)
