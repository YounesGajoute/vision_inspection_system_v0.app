# Master Image Upload Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Feature Implemented

Added the ability to load master images from a laptop/computer in addition to capturing from the camera.

---

## What Was Changed

### Modified File

**File:** `components/wizard/Step2MasterImage.tsx`

**Changes Made:**

1. ✅ Added file upload functionality
2. ✅ Added file input element (hidden, triggered by button)
3. ✅ Added "Load File" button with upload icon
4. ✅ Implemented file validation (type and size)
5. ✅ Added FileReader for converting images to base64
6. ✅ Added image source tracking (camera vs upload)
7. ✅ Updated UI to show 3 buttons: Capture | Load File | Register
8. ✅ Added image source indicator (shows camera or filename)
9. ✅ Updated instructions to explain both options

---

## New Features

### 1. Load from Computer Button

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Capture]  [Load File]  [Register]     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**"Load File"** button opens file browser to select images from computer.

### 2. File Validation

**Type Check:** Only image files accepted  
**Size Limit:** Maximum 10MB  
**Formats:** JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, GIF, WebP, etc.

### 3. Image Source Indicator

Shows where the image came from:
- 📷 "Image captured from camera"
- 📁 "Image loaded from: filename.jpg"

### 4. Updated Instructions

Now shows two clear options:
- **Option 1:** Capture from Camera (with steps)
- **Option 2:** Load from Computer (with steps)

---

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. User navigates to Step 2: Master Image Registration
2. User has two choices:
   - **A)** Click "Capture" to use camera
   - **B)** Click "Load File" to upload from computer
3. If "Load File":
   - File browser opens
   - User selects image file
   - Image is validated
   - Image preview shows immediately
   - Filename displayed in indicator
4. User clicks "Register" to set as master image
5. Proceeds to next step

### Technical Flow

```
User clicks "Load File"
       ↓
File browser opens
       ↓
User selects image
       ↓
Validation:
  - Check file type (must be image)
  - Check file size (< 10MB)
       ↓
FileReader converts to base64
       ↓
Display image preview
       ↓
Show filename in indicator
       ↓
User clicks "Register"
       ↓
Image saved to program config
```

## Code Changes

### New Imports
```typescript
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';  // Added useRef
import { Upload, FileImage } from 'lucide-react';     // Added icons
```

### New State Variables
```typescript
const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = useState(false);
const [imageSource, setImageSource] = useState<'camera' | 'upload' | null>(null);
const [uploadedFileName, setUploadedFileName] = useState<string | null>(null);
const fileInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
```

### New Functions
```typescript
const handleFileSelect = () => {
  fileInputRef.current?.click();
};

const handleFileChange = async (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  // Validates file type and size
  // Reads file as base64
  // Updates state and displays image
};
```

### Updated Functions
```typescript
const handleCapture = async () => {
  // ... existing code ...
  setImageSource('camera');  // Added
  setUploadedFileName(null);  // Added
};
```

## Validation Rules

### File Type
- ✅ Must be an image file
- ❌ Rejects: PDFs, documents, videos, etc.
- Error: "Please select an image file (JPEG, PNG, etc.)"

### File Size
- ✅ Must be ≤ 10MB
- ❌ Rejects: Files larger than 10MB
- Error: "Please select an image smaller than 10MB"

### Format Support
All browser-supported image formats:
- JPEG / JPG
- PNG
- BMP
- TIFF / TIF
- GIF
- WebP
- SVG
- ICO

---

## UI Changes

### Before
```
[Capture Image]  [Register Master]
```

### After
```
[Capture]  [Load File]  [Register]
```

### New Elements

1. **Load File Button**
   - Icon: Upload
   - Variant: Outline
   - Opens file browser

2. **Image Source Indicator**
   - Blue background
   - Shows camera icon or file icon
   - Displays source information

3. **Hidden File Input**
   - Type: file
   - Accept: image/*
   - Triggered by Load File button

4. **Updated Instructions Card**
   - Two options clearly shown
   - File size and format info
   - Step-by-step for each method

---

## Error Handling

### Invalid File Type
```typescript
toast({
  title: "Invalid File",
  description: "Please select an image file (JPEG, PNG, etc.)",
  variant: "destructive"
});
```

### File Too Large
```typescript
toast({
  title: "File Too Large",
  description: "Please select an image smaller than 10MB",
  variant: "destructive"
});
```

### Load Failed
```typescript
toast({
  title: "Load Failed",
  description: "Failed to read image file",
  variant: "destructive"
});
```

## Benefits

### 1. Flexibility
- Use existing reference images
- No need for physical sample on-site
- Remote configuration possible

### 2. Convenience
- Faster setup with pre-existing images
- Easy to test different reference images
- Import from any source

### 3. Quality Control
- Use professionally captured images
- Consistent lighting and positioning

Set up inspection programs without being on-site.

### Testing & Development
Quickly test with different reference images during development.

### Multiple Stations
Use the same reference image across multiple inspection systems.

### Quality Assurance
Use certified "golden sample" images.

### Documentation
Maintain library of reference images for different products.
