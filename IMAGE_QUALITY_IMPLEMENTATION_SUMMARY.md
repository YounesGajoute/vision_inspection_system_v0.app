# Image Quality Consistency Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Objective:** Ensure master images and captured test images have consistent quality for accurate template matching and inspection.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

### Issue
For accurate vision inspection, **master reference images must have the same quality as captured test images**. Quality mismatches lead to:

- Template matching failures (position adjustment tool)
- Incorrect matching rates (outline, area, edge tools)
- False positives/negatives in inspection
- Inconsistent results over time

### Root Causes
1. **Undefined compression parameters** - `cv2.imwrite()` used default compression
2. **Uploaded image artifacts** - JPEG compression artifacts in uploaded masters
3. **No validation** - No checks for quality consistency between master and test
4. **Format inconsistency** - Mixed use of PNG/JPEG without explicit quality settings

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Master Image Storage Enhancement

**File:** `backend/src/core/program_manager.py`

**Changes:**
```python
def save_master_image(self, program_id, image, format='png'):
    # Added explicit compression parameters
    if format.lower() in ['png']:
        # PNG: Lossless, compression level 1 (fast)
        compression_params = [cv2.IMWRITE_PNG_COMPRESSION, 1]
    elif format.lower() in ['jpg', 'jpeg']:
        # JPEG: Quality 100 (maximum, minimal artifacts)
        compression_params = [cv2.IMWRITE_JPEG_QUALITY, 100]
    
    success = cv2.imwrite(file_path, image_bgr, compression_params)
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Lossless PNG storage (default)
- ‚úÖ Consistent quality across all master images
- ‚úÖ No compression artifacts
- ‚úÖ Fast write performance (level 1)

### 2. Uploaded Image Re-encoding

**File:** `backend/src/api/routes.py`

**Changes:**
```python
@api.route('/master-image', methods=['POST'])
def upload_master_image():
    # Decode uploaded image to raw numpy array
    image = cv2.imdecode(file_bytes, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
    image_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    
    # Re-encode with consistent quality (PNG lossless)
    # This removes original compression artifacts
    image_path = program_manager.save_master_image(program_id, image_rgb)
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Uploaded images re-encoded to match camera captures
- ‚úÖ Original compression artifacts removed
- ‚úÖ Consistent quality regardless of source

### 3. Image Quality Validation

**File:** `backend/src/hardware/camera.py`

**New Method:** `validate_image_quality(image)`

```python
def validate_image_quality(self, image):
    """Returns quality metrics: brightness, sharpness, exposure, score"""
    # Brightness: target 100-150 (30% weight)
    # Sharpness: Laplacian variance (50% weight)
    # Exposure: clipping detection (20% weight)
    # Overall score: 0-100
```

**Metrics:**
- **Brightness:** Average pixel value (target: 100-150)
- **Sharpness:** Laplacian variance (higher = sharper)
- **Exposure:** Over/under-exposure detection
- **Overall Score:** Weighted average (0-100)

### 4. Image Consistency Validation

**File:** `backend/src/hardware/camera.py`

**New Method:** `validate_image_consistency(master_image, captured_image)`

```python
def validate_image_consistency(self, master_image, captured_image):
    """
    Checks:
    - Resolution consistency (must match)
    - Brightness difference (within 20%)
    - Sharpness difference (within 30%)
    - Overall quality scores (both > 50)
    
    Returns: {
        consistent: bool,
        issues: [],      # Critical problems
        warnings: [],    # Non-critical warnings
        recommendation: str
    }
    """
```

**Validation Thresholds:**
| Check | Threshold | Severity |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Resolution | Exact match | Critical |
| Brightness | ¬±20% | Warning |
| Sharpness | 70-130% | Warning |
| Overall quality | Both > 50 | Warning |

### 5. Runtime Quality Monitoring

**File:** `backend/src/core/inspection_engine.py`

**Changes:**
```python
def run_inspection_cycle(self):
    image = self.camera.capture_image(...)
    
    # Quality consistency check (first cycle only)
    if not hasattr(self, '_quality_checked'):
        self._quality_checked = True
        if self.master_image is not None:
            consistency = self.camera.validate_image_consistency(
                self.master_image, image
            )
            # Log warnings/errors for quality issues
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic quality check on first inspection
- ‚úÖ Early warning of consistency issues
- ‚úÖ Logged for troubleshooting
- ‚úÖ Non-blocking (doesn't fail inspection)

## üîç Technical Details

### Image Storage Format

**Master Images:**
```
Format: PNG (default)
Compression: Level 1 (lossless, fast)
Color Space: RGB
Bit Depth: 8-bit per channel
Location: storage/master_images/
```

**Runtime Captures:**
```
Format: Numpy array (no compression)
Color Space: RGB
Source: Picamera2 (Raspberry Pi) or cv2.VideoCapture (dev)
Memory only: Not saved to disk during inspection
```

### Quality Metrics

**Brightness Score:**
```python
target_brightness = 125 (gray level 0-255)
brightness_score = 100 * (1 - |brightness - 125| / 125)
range: 0-100 (100 = perfect)
```

**Sharpness Score:**
```python
sharpness = variance(Laplacian(image))
sharpness_score = min(100, sharpness / 5)
typical good images: 100-500+ variance
range: 0-100 (higher = sharper)
```

**Exposure Score:**
```python
over_exposed = pixels > 250 / total_pixels
under_exposed = pixels < 5 / total_pixels
exposure_score = 100 * (1 - over_exposed - under_exposed)
range: 0-100 (100 = no clipping)
```

**Overall Score:**
```python
overall = 0.3 * brightness_score + 
          0.5 * sharpness_score + 
          0.2 * exposure_score
```

### Consistency Thresholds

**Brightness Consistency:**
```python
threshold = 0.2 * master_brightness  # ¬±20%
consistent = |master_brightness - captured_brightness| <= threshold
```

**Sharpness Consistency:**
```python
ratio = captured_sharpness / master_sharpness
consistent = 0.7 <= ratio <= 1.3  # 70-130%
```
