## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Master Image Storage

**Before:**
```python
# Undefined compression, default parameters
cv2.imwrite(file_path, image_bgr)
```

**After:**
```python
# Explicit quality parameters
if format == 'png':
    compression_params = [cv2.IMWRITE_PNG_COMPRESSION, 1]  # Lossless, fast
elif format == 'jpg':
    compression_params = [cv2.IMWRITE_JPEG_QUALITY, 100]   # Maximum quality

cv2.imwrite(file_path, image_bgr, compression_params)
```

### Quality Validation

**New Method: `validate_image_quality(image)`**
```python
Returns:
{
    'brightness': 125.5,   # Average pixel value (0-255)
    'sharpness': 250.3,    # Laplacian variance
    'exposure': 98.5,      # Clipping detection (0-100)
    'score': 85.7          # Overall quality (0-100)
}
```

**New Method: `validate_image_consistency(master, captured)`**
```python
Returns:
{
    'consistent': True,           # No critical issues
    'issues': [],                 # Critical problems (resolution, etc.)
    'warnings': [...],            # Non-critical warnings
    'master_quality': {...},      # Master image metrics
    'captured_quality': {...},    # Captured image metrics
    'recommendation': 'Images are consistent for matching'
}
```

### Runtime Monitoring

**Automatic Check on First Inspection:**
```python
if not hasattr(self, '_quality_checked'):
    self._quality_checked = True
    if self.master_image is not None:
        consistency = self.camera.validate_image_consistency(
            self.master_image, image
        )
        # Log warnings/errors, but continue inspection
```

```

### 3. User Verification Steps
```bash
# Step 1: Check master image storage
ls -lh storage/master_images/
# Should see: program_X_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png

# Step 2: Check quality logs
grep "Master image saved with high quality" logs/backend.log
# Should see: format=png confirmation

# Step 3: Check consistency validation
grep "Quality check:" logs/backend.log
# Should see: consistency recommendations

# Step 4: Verify no errors
grep -i "ERROR.*quality" logs/backend.log
# Should see: no errors (or only warnings)
```
