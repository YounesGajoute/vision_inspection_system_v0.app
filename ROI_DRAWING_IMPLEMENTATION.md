# ROI Drawing Process - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented the correct ROI (Region of Interest) drawing process with automatic edit mode after drawing.

---

## ✨ New Features Implemented

### 1. **Three-State Mode System**
- `none` - Ready to select tool and draw
- `drawing` - User is actively drawing the ROI rectangle
- `editing` - ROI drawn, user can resize/move before saving

### 2. **Automatic Edit Mode Entry**
When user releases mouse after drawing:
- ✅ Rectangle is validated (minimum 10x10 pixels)
- ✅ Automatically enters EDIT MODE
- ✅ Shows 8 resize handles (4 corners + 4 edges)
- ✅ Toast notification: "ROI Created - Adjust the ROI or click 'Save Tool' to confirm"

### 3. **8 Resize Handles**
- **Corner Handles**: `TL`, `TR`, `BL`, `BR` - Resize both dimensions
- **Edge Handles**: `T`, `B`, `L`, `R` - Resize single dimension
- **Visual Design**: White squares with colored borders
- **Size**: 8x8 pixels for easy clicking

### 4. **Move Functionality**
- Click and drag anywhere inside the ROI body to move it
- Maintains ROI dimensions while moving
- Handle detection: `move` mode when clicking inside rectangle

### 5. **Interactive Threshold Adjustment**
- Threshold slider is **enabled only in edit mode**
- Title changes to "Adjust Threshold" during editing
- Displays helper text: "Adjust the threshold for the current ROI"
- Real-time updates as user adjusts slider

### 6. **Save/Cancel Buttons**
Located below canvas, appear only in edit mode:

**Save Tool Button** (Primary)
- ✅ Green checkmark icon
- Adds tool to configured tools list
- Resets edit mode and clears temporary ROI
- Resets threshold to default (65)

**Cancel Button** (Outline)
- ❌ Red X icon
- Discards temporary ROI
- Returns to normal state
- Shows cancellation toast

### 7. **UI State Management**
- **Tool selection disabled** during drawing/editing
- **Delete buttons disabled** during editing
- **Cursor changes** based on mode:
  - `cursor-crosshair` - Drawing mode
  - `cursor-move` - Edit mode
  - `cursor-not-allowed` - No tool selected

### 8. **Canvas Title Updates**
- Normal: "Draw ROI (Region of Interest)"
- Edit Mode: "Edit ROI - Drag handles to resize, drag body to move"

## 🔄 Complete User Flow

```
1. User clicks tool type button (e.g., "Area Tool")
   ↓
2. Cursor changes to crosshair
   ↓
3. User clicks and drags on canvas
   ↓
4. Dashed rectangle preview appears during drag
   ↓
5. User releases mouse
   ↓
6. 🎯 AUTOMATICALLY ENTERS EDIT MODE
   ↓
7. Solid rectangle with 8 white resize handles appears
   ↓
8. Title changes to "Edit ROI - Drag handles to resize, drag body to move"
   ↓
9. Threshold slider becomes enabled with helper text
   ↓
10. "Save Tool" and "Cancel" buttons appear below canvas
   ↓
11. User can:
    - Drag corner handles → Resize both dimensions
    - Drag edge handles → Resize one dimension
    - Drag ROI body → Move entire ROI
    - Adjust threshold slider → Change tool threshold
   ↓
12. User clicks "Save Tool"
    ↓
13. Tool added to "Configured Tools" list
    ↓
14. Returns to normal state (ready for next tool)
    ↓
15. Threshold resets to 65, cursor to crosshair
```

## 🛡️ Validation & Constraints

### Size Validation
- Minimum ROI size: 10x10 pixels
- If too small → Discarded, returns to normal mode

### Tool Limits
- Maximum 16 tools per program
- Position Adjust tool: Maximum 1
- Checks performed before allowing draw

### Negative Dimension Handling
- Drawing backwards (right-to-left, bottom-to-top) supported
- Automatically normalizes to positive dimensions
- Prevents negative width/height during resize

### Boundary Constraints
- ROI can be moved anywhere on 640x480 canvas
- Width/height kept positive during resize operations

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Variables Added
```typescript
const [editMode, setEditMode] = useState<EditMode>('none');
const [activeHandle, setActiveHandle] = useState<ResizeHandle>(null);
const [dragStart, setDragStart] = useState<{ x: number; y: number } | null>(null);
```

### New Functions
1. `drawResizeHandles()` - Renders 8 handles in edit mode
2. `getHandleAtPosition()` - Detects which handle/area clicked
3. `handleSaveTool()` - Saves tool and resets state
4. `handleCancelTool()` - Cancels editing and clears ROI
5. `getCursorStyle()` - Returns appropriate cursor class

### Mouse Event Handling
- **Mouse Down**: 
  - Edit mode → Detect handle/body click
  - Normal mode → Start drawing
- **Mouse Move**: 
  - Drawing → Update preview rectangle
  - Editing → Resize/move based on active handle
- **Mouse Up**: 
  - Drawing → Enter edit mode
  - Editing → Release handle
